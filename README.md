# Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
- [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) (for mock API)

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Install `json-server`

To set up a local mock API, you will need to install `json-server` globally. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g json-server
```
### Step 2: Start the Mock API Server

After installation, you can start the mock server using the following command:

```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3032
```
This will serve the db.json file at http://localhost:3032, simulating a REST API.

### Step 3: Set Up and Run the Front-End Project
1. Navigate to your front-end project directory.
2. Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
### Step 4: Configuring API Endpoints

If your project uses private APIs or requires authentication, ensure you have set up your backend and exposed the necessary endpoints.

For local development, ensure your API endpoints match the following structure:
```bash
const API_URL1 = 'http://localhost:5001/api/v1';
```
#### Note: The above endpoint is used for local development. This endpoint must be available and running before you can access private or login-protected routes. Ensure your backend service is correctly configured to match this URL.

### Step 5: Deploying Your Project
Before deploying your project, ensure the API endpoints are correctly configured to point to your live server rather than the local localhost URLs. Update the API_URL1 constant and any other relevant configurations according to your live environment's API structure.

Additional Notes
* Remember to adjust the endpoints in your production environment to point to your live API server.
* Follow best practices for security and optimization when moving to production.
